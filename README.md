# TODO_API
Good old TODO API (without any frameworks or packages) (plain package.json)  Database - file system - file permission (linux basics) Change the single index.js file into an MVC pattern  Development tools in this level * Postman * IDE/editor setup for faster development cycle * Better comments plugin on vs code for documenting the code (mandatory since we are keeping the documents within the code)
